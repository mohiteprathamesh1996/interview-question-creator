"3. How do Workbench report summaries rely on the PAF output for generating accurate and informative data representations in the Analytics Catalog, especially when considering extension-based actions in Cogito?","Workbench report summaries rely on the data returned by the PAF columns for grouping and aggregation purposes. The PAF columns play a significant role in providing the necessary data for creating accurate and informative representations in the Analytics Catalog. When considering extension-based actions in Cogito, the PAF output ensures that the columns and data used for analysis and reporting are structured and formatted correctly to reflect the desired information effectively. This ensures that the summaries generated in Workbench reports are based on reliable data sources, enhancing the overall quality of the analytics presented in the Analytics Catalog."
4. In what ways can users utilize the Explore tab in Workbench to further analyze and summarize data for reporting purposes in the Analytics Catalog within the framework of report groups in Cogito?,"Users can utilize the Explore tab in Workbench to create their own summaries with the SlicerDicer interface. The summaries created in the Explore tab can be saved as views of the report results and will be available to all users who run the report within the results. However, these summaries can be grouped and aggregated based on only the displayed PAF columns, not those listed as ""Available"" in the Display tab.

In the context of report groups in Cogito, users can access the reports they create in the Explore tab if they share a report group with the report. If a user and a report share at least one report group, the user will be able to find and access the report in the Analytics Catalog. Assigning report groups to templates is important to make these templates and their corresponding reports available to users who are part of those report groups."
"5. How can users create and customize table and graph components in Workbench to visually represent summarized data effectively in the Analytics Catalog, considering the distribution of dashboards based on user types in Cogito?","Users can create and customize table and graph components in Workbench to visually represent summarized data effectively by selecting Table or Graph as the display format in the Component Editor. The data source for these components can come from Reporting Workbench reports, dashboard resources, saved SlicerDicer sessions, or Code Templates. The settings for these components are crucial for both table and graph components, including the summary selection, report model or report choice, allowing users to view the report, enabling drill-down functionality, and setting parameters.

In terms of distribution of dashboards based on user types in Cogito, users can create dashboards based on the type of user they are targeting. They can select the appropriate data sources and summary types to create components such as tables or graphs to display the summarized data effectively based on the needs and preferences of the user type. The decision to choose between table or graph components is primarily cosmetic and can be based on the user's design preference.

It's important for users to understand the different roles in Cogito teams and how they collaborate to build, validate, and distribute reports effectively. By understanding the roles and responsibilities of team members, users can create components and dashboards tailored to the needs of different stakeholders within the organization."
